# Supplementary material for NeurIPS 2020 submission

Run the following command to install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Example ipython notebook file for running our algorithm is provided in 'trainer.ipynb'.
For those who want to reproduce our results, we also attach the raw data file of four benchmark datasets.

### Supported benchmark datasets include;
- Moon dataset (Scikit-Learn's Moon dataset along with sensitive attribute generation)
- Law School Admissions
- Adult Census Income
- Credit Card Default
- COMPAS Recidivism

We tested the code on a number of different machines that have Python 3.7.4 or 3.7.5 with Ubuntu 16.04 OS.
